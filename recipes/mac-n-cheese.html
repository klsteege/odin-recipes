                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>
                    This mac & cheese has been a part of my life from the beginning.
                    It is creamy and gooey with just the right amount of stringiness to the cheese.

                <ul><h2>Ingredients</h2></ul>
                    <li>8 oz macaroni - the shape is up to you!</li>
                    <li>8 oz cheddar cheese</li>
                    <li>1 Tbs butter</li>
                    <li>1-2 Tbs flour</li>

                    <li>1 cup whole milk</li>

                <ol><h2>Steps</h2></ol>
                    <li>Preheat oven to 350</li>
                    <li>Cook macaroni to al dente in large pot. Drain and leave in drainer - can add a small amount of butter to prevent sticking</li>
                    <li>In same pot, melt the butter over low heat, then slowly stir in flour until it forms a paste.
                        Can continue until it starts to brown if you prefer that flavoring.</li>
                    <li>Slowly add & stir in a small amount of milk at a time until all milk & flour is combined.
                        Once all milk is in, continue to stir over heat until mixture starts to thicken.</li>
                    <li>Slowly mix in cheese, rasing heat if needed to melt it, then tuna</li>
                    <li>Once cheese is melted, add macaroni back to pot and mix well</li>
                    <li>Bake in oven-safe dish for 20 minutes</li>
                    <li>Allow to cool before serving</li>
