# odin-recipes
The Odin Recipe Project

This project is strictly HTML (structure/content, not for presentation).

It is a website to house recipes. It includes an index page that links to individual pages for each recipe.

Completing this project will involve writing a list of links on the index page and linking them to other pages that display the recipes.
